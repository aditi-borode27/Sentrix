SENTRIX PROJECT: OPENSENSE FIREWALL ARCHITECTURAL OVERVIEW
============================================================

1. CORE FUNCTION
------------------------------------------------------------
In the Sentrix environment, OPNsense acts as the Statefull 
Packet Inspection (SPI) gateway. It manages all traffic 
flowing between the NAT (WAN/External) and the Bridge 
(LAN/Internal) interfaces.

2. SEGMENTATION & ADAPTER LOGIC
------------------------------------------------------------
- WAN ZONE (NAT): Acts as the "Internet" interface. It 
  provides the public-facing IP used to establish the 
  OpenVPN tunnel with the remote site.
- LAN ZONE (BRIDGE): Acts as the "Internal Office" network. 
  It hosts sensitive services including Active Directory, 
  ELK, and Uptime Kuma.
- TUNNEL ZONE (OVPN): A virtual interface created to bridge 
  Site-A and Site-B, allowing secure cross-subnet routing.

3. SECURITY POSTURE
------------------------------------------------------------
- DEFAULT DENY: All unsolicited inbound traffic from the 
  WAN is dropped unless explicitly permitted by a rule.
- ENCAPSULATION: All inter-site traffic is encrypted via 
  AES-256-GCM before leaving the physical network.
- DNS PROTECTION: The firewall is configured to intercept 
  standard DNS requests and force resolution through the 
  Windows Domain Controller for AD compliance.

4. KEY IMPLEMENTATION HIGHLIGHTS
------------------------------------------------------------
- Managed the 192.168.x.x "Private Network" conflict by 
  disabling bogon/private block rules on the WAN.
- Optimized routing tables to ensure the Debian 12 nodes 
  can reach the Mumbai DC via the 'tun0' interface without 
  hairpinning through the physical gateway.
