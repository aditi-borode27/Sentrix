============================================================
PROJECT NAME: SENTRIX
ARCHITECTURE: DUAL-SITE VIRTUALIZED INFRASTRUCTURE
COMPONENTS: VPN, AD, MONITORING, & CORE NETWORK SERVICES
============================================================

1. NETWORK SERVICES (DHCP & DNS)
------------------------------------------------------------
- DHCP Server: Managed by the Windows DC to automatically 
  assign IP addresses to LAN (Bridge) clients.
- DNS Name Resolution: Centralized via Active Directory DNS.
- Logic: All nodes (Windows & Linux) use the DC as the 
  Primary DNS to resolve 'sentrix.local' and inter-site IPs.

2. VPN TUNNEL (S2S OPENVPN)
------------------------------------------------------------
- WAN Side: NAT Adapter (External/Tunnel Path).
- LAN Side: Bridge Adapter (Internal Subnet).
- Tunnel: OpenVPN Site-to-Site (AES-256-GCM encryption).

3. IDENTITY MANAGEMENT
------------------------------------------------------------
- Domain Controller: Windows Server (AD DS).
- Linux Integration: Joining Linux nodes via SSSD/Realmd.
- Name Resolution: Essential for the Realm Join process.

4. MONITORING STACK (ELK & UPTIME KUMA)
------------------------------------------------------------
- ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana):
  * Centralized logging for VPN tunnels and AD login events.
  * Used for security auditing and traffic analysis.
- Uptime Kuma:
  * Self-hosted monitoring for service availability.
  * Healthchecks: Monitoring the VPN tunnel, DC status, 
    and DNS responsiveness.
- Healthcheck Kuma: Specialized triggers to alert if 
  site-to-site connectivity latency exceeds thresholds.

5. ARCHITECTURE GOAL
------------------------------------------------------------
A fully monitored, cross-platform environment where Linux 
and Windows resources communicate securely across virtual 
sites with automated IP addressing and name resolution.
